# CRUD-using-JSON-Server
command to run the server : npm start

The following HTTP endpoints are created automatically by JSON server:
* GET    /employees
* GET    /employees/{id}
* POST   /employees
* PUT    /employees/{id}
* PATCH  /employees/{id}
* DELETE /employees/{id}

If you make POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE requests, changes will be automatically saved to db.json. A POST, PUT or PATCH request should include a "Content-Type: application/json" header to use the JSON in the request body. Otherwise it will result in a 200 OK but without changes being made to the data.

if you need a larger amount of data the manual way can be cumbersome. An easy solution to this problem is to use the Faker.js (https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/) library to generate fake data. 

npm install faker
